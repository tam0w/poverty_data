## Estimation of National Poverty using Data Analysis

This notebook attempts to analyse and estimate poverty indicators at the Indian district level. We consider various parameters from the 2011 census data that may be relevant to the estimation of poverty in a district.

To estimate and mesaure poverty we use the multi-dimensional poverty index (MPI) based on the 2023 NITI Aayog report which has the headcount of persons under the MPI line for the years 2014 and 2019. We will be using the head-count of the 2014 MPI for each district. At the time of 2011 census, there were a recorded 640 districts. The HCR values will be considered for only these districts. There is no available data for a poverty indicator at the district level in the year 2011.
